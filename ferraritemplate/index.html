            In 1945, Ferrari introduced a V12 engine which became one of its
            signatures. It wasn't until 1947, nearly ten years after Enzo left
            Alfa that the first Ferrari model the 125 S or 125 Sport, rolled out
            of the factory entrance of the Via Abetone Inferiore in Maranello,
            Italy. There were only two models originally produced. The car was
            entered into its first competitive race in May of that year at the
            Piacenza Circuit, The car was set to be released earlier, however,
            the date was pushed back due to the effects of World War II. After
            the Modena factory was hit by bombs, the company moved to Maranello
            and built the legendary factory that it still uses today.

            Enzo Ferrari was said to have been born on 18 February 1898 in
            Modena, Italy and that his birth was recorded on 20 February because
            a heavy snowstorm had prevented his father from reporting the birth
            at the local registry office; in reality, his birth certificate
            states he was born on 20 February 1898, while the birth's
            registration took place on 24 February 1898 and was reported by the
            midwife.[2] He was the younger of two children to Alfredo Ferrari
            and Adalgisa Bisbini, after his elder sibling Alfredo Junior (Dino).
            Alfredo Senior was the son of a grocer from Carpi, and started a
            workshop fabricating metal parts at the family home.[3] Enzo grew up
            with little formal education. At the age of 10 he witnessed Felice
            Nazzaro's win at the 1908 Circuito di Bologna, an event that
            inspired him to become a racing driver.

          <h2 style="font-weight: lighter">Racing career</h2>
          <p class="normal">
            Following the family's carpentry business collapse, Ferrari started
            searching for a job in the car industry. He unsuccessfully
            volunteered his services to Fiat in Turin, eventually settling for a
            job as test-driver for C.M.N. (Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali), a
            car manufacturer in Milan which rebuilt used truck bodies into small
            passenger cars. He was later promoted to race car driver and made
            his competitive debut in the 1919 Parma-Poggio di Berceto hillclimb
            race, where he finished fourth in the three-litre category at the
            wheel of a 2.3-litre 4-cylinder C.M.N. 15/20. On 23 November of the
            same year, he took part in the Targa Florio but had to retire after
            his car's fuel tank developed a leak.
